        <p>A web designer is a professional who is responsible for designing and creating the visual layout and user interface of websites. They use a variety of design techniques, tools, and programming languages to create web pages that are visually appealing, easy to use, and meet the needs of the website's intended audience. Web designers may work on their own as freelancers, or as part of a team in a design agency or company. They typically collaborate with web developers, who are responsible for the technical implementation of the website, to create a website that meets the client's specifications
  Some common tasks of a web designer include creating mockups and prototypes, designing graphics and layouts, selecting and manipulating images, and working with HTML, CSS, and other programming languages to create a functional and visually appealing website. They may also be responsible for ensuring the website is optimized for search engines, mobile devices, and other technologies.</p>
